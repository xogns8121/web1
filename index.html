  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>
    Web 2.0, also called Participative (or Participatory) and Social Web, refers to World Wide Web websites that emphasize user-generated content, usability (ease of use, even by non-experts), participatory culture and interoperability (this means that a website can work well with other products, systems, and devices) for end users. The term was invented by Darcy DiNucci in 1999 and popularized several years later by Tim O'Reilly and Dale Dougherty at the O'Reilly Media Web 2.0 Conference in late 2004. Web 2.0 does not refer to an update to any technical specification, but to changes in the way Web pages are designed and used. The transition was progressive and there is no precise date on which the change occurred.
